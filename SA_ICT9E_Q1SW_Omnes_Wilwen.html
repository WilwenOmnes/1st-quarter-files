	<dl>
		<dt><b>Blox Fruits</b></dt>
		<dd>is an online fighting game with <b>hundreds of different setups and builds for your liking</b>.<br>The game
		requires a metric ton of <b>grinding and thus people cheat often by getting bot <br>accounts</b>. This game has
		something known as <b>devil fruits and each fruit has different <br>passives and abilities to help you max out</b>
		really quick. These passives are different for <br>each fruit and even the worst abilities can still be used
	due to its incredible passive.</dd>
	</dl>

<h3>My favorite thing to do in Blox fruits is pvp, and due to pvp, I need to learn blox fruits comboes</h3>

<h4>Blox Fruit Comboes are</h4>
<ul>
	<li>hard</li>
	<li>Fun(when landed)</li>
	<li>VERY annoying to the opponent</li>
	<li>Killers of time</li>
	<li>Incredible HP drain</li>
	<li>unique to its user</li>
</ul>

<pre><h3>
Each combo is different for each build. There is no "real" <br>best combo in the game, though there are some comboes <br>that perform WAY BETTER than others.</h3>
</pre>

<h3>
For example: (I will be using the actual terms that the community also uses).</h3>
<h4> 
<ol>
	<li>Kitsune C + X</li> 
	<li>Godhuman X + Godhuman Z + Godhuman C</li>
	<li>CDK X + CDK Z(hold)</li>
	<li>Soul Guitar Z + Soul Guitar X</li>
	<li>(Aim at player) Kitsune Z + Kitsune F + Kitsune M1's.</h4></li>
</ol>
</h4>
<h4>You must also keep in mind to do ALL OF THESE STEPS IN <br>ORDER and in QUICK SUCCESSION to land the combo.</h4>
<h1> This is my original copy:</h1>

<h4>There are so many build you can choose from and some people really MASTER the art of comboing</h4>
<h3>Like <ol>
	<li>Goujoshiki</li>
	<li>NoveExility</li>
	<li>Iblisec</li>
<h3></ol>
And Possible many more players we haven't heard of.</h3>
<h4>And thats why I love the game. The thrill of fighting
and meeting these people is over the roof, I do want
to meet them which is why I played this game and
fell inlove with it.</h4>
